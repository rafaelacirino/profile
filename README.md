<p align="justify"> I graduated in Law at the State University of Paraiba – UEPB and I am currently studying a Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at the Federal Institute of Paraiba – IFPB, both in Campina Grande-PB, Brazil, with almost a decade in the Legal area as a Consultant and Lawyer, but always immersed in the field of technology.

  Presently I am a graduate student at the Specialization of Analytics and Business Intelligence at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais – PUCMG, Brazil. 
As a Computer Engineering student, my focus nowadays is on Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 

  I am an enthusiast learner of all areas of the computer field and I am also fond of learning new languages and new cultures. I can speak with ease Portuguese, Spanish, English, and I can read some French.</p>
